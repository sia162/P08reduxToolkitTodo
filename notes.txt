step 1:
folder - app, store.js in it
create store, configure store; just import statements

step 2: 
creating reducers
we call them slices here in redux toolkit
feature folder: can have many featuresfolders inside it
adding methods.
exporting reducers in three steps.
export slice,reducer,reduced methods

step 3: 
store also needs awareness about reducer 
so import there


step 4: 
using these in components to get access to values or sending values to add data
 - useDispatch, disptach uses reducers to make changes in store
 - useSelector, this method gives access to state(which has all data)


step 5:
here also we need provider, wrapper
passing values in provider
and need;
store?
